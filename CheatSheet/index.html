        <h2 class="selectors">What are CSS Selectors?</h2>
        <p class="selectorinfo">A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other
            terms that tell the
            browser which
            HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.</p>

                    element</td>

                <td class="example">CSS=a:hover</td>
                <td class="info">This group of selectors includes pseudo-classes, which style certain states of an element. The :hover pseudo-class for
                example selects an element only when it is being hovered over by the mouse pointer:</td>

                <td class="info">It also includes pseudo-elements, which select a certain part of an element rather than the element itself. For example,
                ::first-line always selects the first line of text inside an element (a &lt;p&gt; in the below case), acting as if a &lt;span&gt;
                        was wrapped around the first formatted line and then selected.</td>

                <td class="info">The final group of selectors combine other selectors in order to target elements within our documents. The following,
                for example, selects paragraphs that are direct children of &lt;article&gt; elements using the child combinator (>):</td>
